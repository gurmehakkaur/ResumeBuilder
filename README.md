# LazyMe

This is the public version of LazyMe web application developed for project Management and Implementation course. 

## About the application:
The modern job application process demands tailored resumes for each posting to pass automated Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). However, customizing resumes manually is time-consuming, inefficient, and stressful—especially for students and job seekers applying to multiple roles per week.
LazyMe is a browser extension and web platform that enables one-click resume customization directly from job listing pages. Users upload a master resume once, and LazyMe intelligently tailors and formats new resumes for each job, ensuring accuracy and ATS compliance without repeated manual edits.

Some proofs of developing this application using Agile methodology over 4 sprints.
