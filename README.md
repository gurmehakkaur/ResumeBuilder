This is the official PRJ666 application: **LazyMe**.

LazyMe is built using:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React framework)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Local Setup

## Code Styling

For instructions on code styling, please refer to [CodeStyling.md](./web-app/docs/CodeStyling.md).

## Contributing

- **Never commit directly to the `main` branch.**
- All work should be done using feature branches off of `main`.
- Name your feature branches using the format `<IssueNumber>-issue-title` (e.g., `42-add-login-page`).
- We are not using a `dev` branch since the project is not large enough to require one.
- Open a pull request to merge your feature branch into `main` once your work is ready for review.
