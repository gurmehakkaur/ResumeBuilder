# Code Styling Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to maintain consistent code style throughout the project:

- **Component File Names:**
	- Use Capitalized (PascalCase) file names for React components (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`).
- **Component Exports:**
	- Use `export default function` for component declarations.
- **File Extensions:**
	- Use `.tsx` for React components and `.ts` for utility or logic files.
- **Imports:**
	- Use absolute imports where possible, based on the project configuration.
- **Styling:**
	- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling. Avoid inline styles unless necessary.
- **Formatting:**
	- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces or as defined in the project settings).
	- Run Prettier or the project's formatter before committing code.
- **Naming:**
	- Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components and classes, and UPPER_CASE for constants.
